IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Base quality scores on actual content analysis, not generic values
2. For "contentClarity": assess structure, language, and learning objectives clarity
3. For "contentCompleteness": evaluate if all essential topics are covered adequately
4. For "engagementPotential": consider interactivity, real-world examples, and learner motivation
5. For "contentCurrency": check if information is current and reflects best practices
6. Identify 2-4 specific gaps based on content analysis
7. Provide 3-5 actionable recommendations prioritized by impact
8. Generate 4-6 AI suggestions with implementation steps for the course designer to review and approve
9. Make the assessment professional and evidence-based
